# BARK-QC

BARK-QC is software designed for Kilo Candy Co. with the goal of standardising the quality of all candy produced. This will be accomplished through a feedback process in which a regular temperature reading is fed into a PID  based system for controlling the stove-top heat output. This algorithm will attempt to avoid overshoot through predictive modelling and ML based fine tuning, set on top of the preexisting PID systems.
